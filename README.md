# Technology Substitution Effect between Precipitation and Grain Production in China (2018-2024)

This study is based on NOAA's GHCN-D dataset and China's National Bureau of Statistics grain production data.  
It analyzes the "technological substitution" effect between precipitation and grain production across various provinces in China from 2018 to 2024.  

By combining agricultural production data with precipitation data, the research investigates how technological inputs serve as a substitution mechanism in provinces facing insufficient or unstable precipitation conditions.  

The results reveal that in regions with scarce or volatile precipitation, agricultural production relies more heavily on technology, highlighting these areas' adaptability under natural resource constraints.  

This study offers a new perspective for understanding the dynamic relationship between environmental factors and agricultural technology adaptation.
